#### 1. Setup

Start by cloning the demo repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProspectiveCo/perspective-examples.git
```

Now, let's setup a python virtualenv and install dependencies:

```bash
cd perspective-examples
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Start InfluxDB Docker Container

To start the InfluxDB Docker container, navigate to the `examples/influxdb/streaming` directory and run the provided setup script:

```bash
cd examples/influxdb/influxdb-docker
./start_influxdb.sh
```

This script contains the code to start and setup an [influxdb docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb) with the following configuration:

```bash
# This script runs an InfluxDB container with the following configuration:
docker run -d --rm \
    --name "influxdb_perspective" \
    -p 8086:8086 \
    -e DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_MODE=setup \
    -e DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME="admin" \
    -e DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD="sudo-banana-404" \
    -e DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ORG="perspective" \
    -e DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_BUCKET="smart_grid" \
    -e DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ADMIN_TOKEN="sudo-banana-404" \
    "influxdb:2"
```

Please note the following:
- Influxdb is initiated with `DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD` set to "admin" and "sudo-banana-404".
- Influxdb API token is also set to `sudo-banana-404`.
- We initiate the container with a buket: "smart_grid"

You can now log into the influxdb dashboard: [http://localhost:8086/](http://localhost:8086/). Use `admin` and `sudo-banana-404` as user/pass.

#### 3. Smart Grid NYC Data Generator

Let's start streaming data into the influxdb bucket... 

The smart grid data generator simulates real-time data for New York City's power grid. It generates data points for various power stations, including metrics such as energy consumption, voltage, current, and more. The generated data is pushed to InfluxDB for real-time analysis and visualization.

Run `main.py` which will start the generator and start streaming to influxdb:

```bash
python examples/influxdb/streaming/main.py
```

Let's dig into the code:

```python
"""
Start a smart_grid streaming data generator and send the data to InfluxDB.
"""

# add the project root dir to the python path for modules to import correctly
import os
import sys
sys.path.append('../../../')

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from time import sleep
from utils.logger import logger
from utils.config_loader import config
from generators.smart_grid.new_york_smart_grid import NewYorkSmartGridStreamGenerator
from writers.influxdb_writer import InfluxdbWriter


# ============================================
# DEMO CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
# change these parameters to customize the demo

START_TIME = datetime.now() - timedelta(minutes=0)                  # demo start time
END_TIME = datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=30, seconds=0)        # demo end time
INFLUXDB_URL = 'http://localhost:8086'
INFLUXDB_TOKEN = 'sudo-banana-404'
INFLUXDB_ORG = 'perspective'
INFLUXDB_BUCKET = 'smart_grid'


def main():
    logger.info('-' * 80)
    logger.info('DEMO: INFLUXDB -> PROSPECTIVE')
    logger.info('Starting smart grid streaming data generator...')
    logger.info('Sending data to InfluxDB...')

    # --------------------------------------------
    # DATA GENERATORS & WRITERS

    smart_grid = NewYorkSmartGridStreamGenerator(
        interval=0.250,         # refresh every 0.25 seconds
        nrows=100,              # number of rows to generate in each batch
        num_stations=32,        # number of stations
        start_time=START_TIME,  # start time

        loopback=True,          # loopback if we exhaust the generated data
        )

    # Define the InfluxDB writer
    influx_writer = InfluxdbWriter(
        url=INFLUXDB_URL,
        token=INFLUXDB_TOKEN,
        org=INFLUXDB_ORG,
        bucket=INFLUXDB_BUCKET,

        smart_grid.stop()
        influx_writer.close()
        del influx_writer
        del smart_grid
        logger.info('Demo: Ended New York Smart Grid demo.')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

This script initializes the data generator and configures it to send data to InfluxDB at regular intervals (every 250ms). Please pay attention to the following:

- `START_TIME` sets the start of stream to now (with offset of 0 minutes).
- `END_TIME` sets the end of stream to 30 minutes from now.
- `NewYorkSmartGridStreamGenerator` is the class simulating an smart grid data for New York city power stations. You can follow the code in [`generators/smart_grid/new_york_smart_grid.py`](https://github.com/ProspectiveCo/perspective-examples/blob/main/generators/smart_grid/new_york_smart_grid.py).
- The script also adds a `InfluxdbWriter()` class which streams data to influxdb. You can follow the code in: [`writers/influxdb_writer.py`](https://github.com/ProspectiveCo/perspective-examples/blob/main/writers/influxdb_writer.py).

This will start a background thread which continuously generates and streams data. The main loop can be stopped at any time with CTRL + C. 


#### 4. InfluxDB Dashboard

Let's first start by inspecting the data with the influxdb dashboard: 

- Navigate to Data Explorer on the left panel
- Switch the Script Editor
- Flip the View Raw Data toggle
- Enter the following influxdb query:

```influxql
from(bucket: "smart_grid")
  |> range(start: -1m, stop: 1s)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "new_york_smart_grid")
  |> pivot(rowKey:["_time"], columnKey: ["_field"], valueColumn: "_value")
  |> yield(name: "table")
```

You can see that the data is being streamed properly:

Click on Create New Dashboard and open the SOURCES tab on the top right corner:

- From the drop down choose InfluxDB
- Enter influxdb token: "sudo-banana-404"
- Set the endpoint URL: "http://localhost:8086"
- Set organization to: "perspective" and data pull interval to `0.5` seconds
- Use the same influxdb query:

```influxql
from(bucket: "smart_grid")
  |> range(start: -1m, stop: 1s)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "new_york_smart_grid")
  |> pivot(rowKey:["_time"], columnKey: ["_field"], valueColumn: "_value")
  |> yield(name: "table")
```

![InfluxDB Dashboard](imgs/prsp-02.png)

You can now see the data being imported into the Data Grid view and refreshed every 500ms:

![InfluxDB Dashboard](imgs/prsp-03.png)

You can start interacting and adjusting the view. Click the dashboard title called "untitled" on the top left corner to open the configuration tab.

Once the configuration tab is opened on the right, you can adjust the view setting. Try grouping by station_name and deactivate some of the columns to show:

Probably the best view for this data, is using the Map Scatter plot. Choose Map Scatter, then extend the `Debug JSON` tab by clicking the **`<<`** icon to the top right. Enter the following JSON config view:

```json
{
  "version": "3.2.0",
  "plugin": "Map Scatter",
  "plugin_config": {
    "center": [
      -8228659.670691408,
      4974253.000191102
    ],
    "zoom": 12
  },
  "columns_config": {},
  "settings": true,
  "theme": "Pro Dark",
  "title": null,
  "group_by": [
    "station_name"
  ],
  "split_by": [
    "status"
  ],
  "columns": [
    "longitude",
    "latitude",
    null,
    "energy_consumption",
    null
  ],
  "filter": [],
  "sort": [],
  "expressions": {
    "ts1": "bucket(\"_time\", '1m')"
  },
  "aggregates": {
    "latitude": "last",
    "energy_consumption": "mean",
    "longitude": "last"
  }
}
```

Perspective views can easily be saved to and imported from JSON config. This will initialize the perspective dashboard with all the correct setting.

Perspective viewer pulls data from influxdb at every 500ms interval and refreshes the view. You can see the live power consumption for each station and stations switch ON/OFF regularly based on power outages!
